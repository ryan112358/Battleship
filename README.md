# Battleship

This is my implementation of battleship written with Racket.  This game has high quality realistic graphics and sound, as well as options to play against the computer in single player mode or against a friend over a network in two player mode - one person "hosts" the game by starting a server, and the other person can join that server.  

To run the program, unzip the files, open battleship!.rkt in Dr. Racket, and press run.  It may take some time to get started, as all of the images are embedded in the racket file, so it should take a minute or two to load.
